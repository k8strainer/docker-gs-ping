# docker-gs-ping

A simple Go server/microservice example for [Docker's Go Language Guide](https://docs.docker.com/language/golang/).

Notable features:

* Includes a [multi-stage `Dockerfile`](https://github.com/olliefr/docker-gs-ping/blob/main/Dockerfile.multistage).
* Has a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions to run tests.
* Has a CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to publish to Docker Hub.

There is a more advanced example in [olliefr/docker-gs-ping-roach](https://github.com/olliefr/docker-gs-ping-roach) using [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach).

## Contributing

This was written for an _introduction_ section of the Docker tutorial and as such it favours brevity and pedagogical clarity over robustness. 

Thus, feedback is welcome, but please no nits or pedantry. Ain't nobody got time for that 🙃
